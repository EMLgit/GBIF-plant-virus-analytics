# Load data

I downloaded the full GBIF data for all viruses and can rerun the same inquiry as needed in the future, too:

```{r}
#GBIF download (re-run online in future as needed). This includes all viruses from the GBIF repository, including animal and fungal viruses.
gbifVir <- occ_download_get('0050700-240321170329656') %>%
  occ_download_import()
dim(gbifVir)
names(gbifVir)

gbifVir <- gbifVir %>%
  mutate(spp.clean = tolower(species),
         spp.clean = gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", " ", spp.clean))#add a standardized/cleaned species column to join on


#Load a list of viruses that infect plants so that you can filter the GBIF download to keep only plant viruses. This is from the ICTV.
plantVir <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Research/UNM/Herbaria and plant-virus biogeography/VMR_MSL38_v3_plants.csv")

plantVir = plantVir %>%
  mutate(spp.clean = tolower(Species),
         spp.clean = gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", " ", spp.clean)) #add a standardized/cleaned species column to join on


#filter the gbif data to include only plant viruses, as defined by the family data in the ICTV plantVir dataset (downloaded April 2024)

virDF <- gbifVir %>% #151,689 rows
  semi_join(plantVir, by = c("family" = "Family")) #removes 758,763 rows from the original GBIF download
#I may need to be more specific than this to capture PLANT viruses. Maybe go to the genus level? I'm still getting rabies and a bird virus.

virDF2 <- gbifVir %>% #196,693
  semi_join(plantVir, by = c("genus" = "Genus"))

virDF3 <- gbifVir %>% #73,349
  semi_join(plantVir, by = c("species" = "Species"))


#also retain the rows that were removed to check later
gbifOther <- gbifVir %>% 
  anti_join(plantVir, by = c("family" = "Family")) 



```


#Clean virus dataframe up 
```{r}
#remove rows without sufficient data
virDF<-virDF %>%
  filter(!phylum=="") #removes 8042 rows without phyla 


#probably need to find a way to harmonize virus taxonomy, but I'll keep everything with at least a phyla for now (there are a lot of viruses with missing taxonomic information below phyla, too)

```

#Explore data
```{r}
families <- as.data.frame(table(virDF$family))
species <- as.data.frame(table(virDF$species)) #most viruses don't have species information
spp.verbatim <- as.data.frame(table(virDF$scientificName))
```


#Mapping data
try joining based on country code
```{r}
joinData <- joinCountryData2Map( plantVir,
                                 joinCode = "ISO2",
                                 nameJoinColumn = "countryCode", 
                                 crs=)

theMap <- mapCountryData( joinData, nameColumnToPlot="countryCode", addLegend=FALSE )
#spTransform(theMap, CRS=CRS("+proj=robin +ellps=WGS84"))


#Terra package only
library(terra)
w <- geodata::world(path=".")
plot(w)

rast<- rast(w$GID_0) 


library(tmap)
data("World")

tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons("HPI")

map_nz1 = World +
  tm_shape(plantVir$countryCode) + tm_raster(col_alpha = 0.7)
 
```


```{r}

wrld <- map_data("world")

gg <- ggplot()
gg <- gg + geom_map(data=joinData, map=wrld,
                    aes(x=long, y=lat, map_id=region),
                    color="#2b2b2b", size=0.15, fill=NA)
gg <- gg + coord_proj("+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
