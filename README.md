# GBIF plant virus analytics

The objective of this project is to determine when, where and how virus diversity can be studied at broad (global?) spatial scales using data available through repositories like GBIF and GGBN. 

The conclusions of this work are based on data analysis of large data; they are not results from isolating specific viruses or lab work or any sort of diagnostic workflows.
